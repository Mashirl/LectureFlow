Rules:
- Only fix recognition errors and obvious disfluencies. Never paraphrase, summarise, or improve the lecturer's style.
- Never merge, split, reorder, add, or remove sentences.
- Only output sentences you change. Output the full corrected sentence in "after", without the ⟦ ⟧ marks.
- Only output idx values from the TARGET section. The CONTEXT section is for reference only.
- If unsure whether something is an error, prefer "decide" over guessing silently.

Classify each change:
- "auto": a clear homophone or near-homophone recognition error, and the corrected word appears in the glossary or the slides.
- "absorb": a minor issue (repeated words, filler, small grammar slip, trivial misrecognition) that would not change the meaning of a translation.
- "decide": a change that could alter the meaning, where a human should listen to the audio to confirm.
